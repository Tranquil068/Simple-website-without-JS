# Simple-website-without-JS
This is a simple 'practice' website I  built with only HTML and CSS while following my lessons. 
After a long break, I'm picking up from where I stopped. This simple code serves as a memory-refresher for all the lessons I took 2years ago. Look out for even more exciting projects.
